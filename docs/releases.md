# Releases and compatibility

This page is for release maintainers and downstream consumers. It is the
authoritative contract for version compatibility, release validation, native
and container artifacts, Homebrew updates, and checksum trust. Return to the
[documentation index](README.md) for other task paths. The [public distribution
topology](public-distribution.md) defines the canonical repository and endpoint
ownership used by this process.

Ralphie follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Until 1.0, minor
releases may change the CLI or persisted state schema; patch releases should
remain backward compatible. Release candidates must pass `bun run check` and
document notable changes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Release workflow

The release workflow accepts only strict tags of the form
`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, with numeric components that have no leading zeroes
(`v0.1.0` is valid). Prerelease and build suffixes are not accepted. The tag
version must exactly match `package.json` before artifacts are built. Every run
resolves the tag to its immutable commit before building; a manual dispatch
must be started from the matching protected `version` tag and provide its full
40-character lowercase commit `ref`. A mismatched ref fails before release or
registry publication rather than falling back to the default branch.

The repository must enforce that binding with an active tag ruleset covering
`v*`. Configure **Settings → Rules → Rulesets** to target tags matching `v*`,
restrict both tag updates and deletions, and configure no bypass actors. The
workflow requires the triggering ref to report as protected before it builds;
this protection, rather than a non-atomic API recheck, closes the check/use
race between validation and publication.

Manual dispatches default to `dry_run: true`. Every validated release run
builds and smoke-tests `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` container candidates
without logging into GHCR or pushing public tags. Each platform is staged as
an immutable `actions/upload-artifact@v4` artifact named
`ralphie-container-candidate-<version>-<arch>`. Its
`ralphie-container-<arch>.metadata.json` uses the
`ralphie.container-candidate.v1` contract and records the validated
`source_ref`, platform, OCI archive name and SHA-256, BuildKit image
manifest `digest`, and OCI version/revision labels; the final publisher
must verify those fields before promotion. The canonical GHCR tag is the
normalized package version without `v` (for example, `0.1.0`). The minor
version, `latest` for stable releases only, and `sha-<commit>` are explicit
aliases. A dry run skips GitHub Release and GHCR publication. A normal tag
push is not a dry run and runs release and container publication in the
protected GitHub `release` environment. The native publisher targets the
canonical repository explicitly, creates the tag's release with its assets on
the first run, and reuses it with clobbering uploads on retries so a partial
publication can be repaired without changing the public download URLs.
Repository administrators must configure that environment in **Settings →
Environments → release** with the required reviewer(s); approval is required
before the final publisher can write release assets or packages.

Before staging a release, run the local package smoke check from the checkout:

```bash
bun run package:check
```

It creates and inspects a real tarball, installs it with production dependencies
in a fresh temporary project, and runs the installed executable with Bun. To
inspect only the `npm pack --dry-run` file list, use
`bun run package:inspect`. Registry verification is deliberately opt-in and
uses an isolated npm cache and working directory:

```bash
bun run package:check -- \
  --registry --package-spec @beremaran/ralphie@<release-version>
```

The check does not publish anything. Run the registry form only after the
release version is available from npm.

Each release also contains `SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json`, a canonical Sigstore
bundle for the exact bytes of `SHA256SUMS`. The release publisher uses keyless
Sigstore signing with the GitHub Actions OIDC issuer; no signing key or OIDC
token is stored in the repository, build context, logs, or release metadata.

## Homebrew formula updates

`Formula/ralphie.rb` contains one `sha256` value for each release asset:
`darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-arm64`, and `linux-x64`. After publishing a
release, download `SHA256SUMS` from that same release, update `version` and the
four matching formula branches, and validate the result before submitting the
formula change:

```bash
VERSION=0.1.0
bun run validate:homebrew-formula -- \
  --formula Formula/ralphie.rb \
  --manifest /path/to/SHA256SUMS \
  --version "$VERSION"
```

The validator rejects missing or extra mappings, wrong asset names or release
versions, malformed hashes, and values that differ from the canonical manifest.
Never copy one platform's checksum to another branch or use a placeholder.

## Release checksum trust policy

Downstream consumers must accept a checksum manifest only when its bundle
verifies against all of these constraints:

- issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`;
- repository: `beremaran/ralphie`;
- workflow identity:
  `https://github.com/beremaran/ralphie/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/<tag>`;
- GitHub workflow event: `push` for the exact `refs/tags/<tag>` (or
  `workflow_dispatch` only when the manual run is started from that same
  protected tag); and
- workflow commit: the exact commit targeted by that protected tag.

After downloading both `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json` from the same
release, verify the signature before using the checksums (`--trigger
workflow_dispatch` is used instead for a manually published release):

```bash
TAG=v0.1.0
SOURCE_REF=<40-character commit SHA targeted by $TAG>
sigstore verify github SHA256SUMS \
  --bundle SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json \
  --repository beremaran/ralphie \
  --name Release \
  --cert-identity "https://github.com/beremaran/ralphie/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/$TAG" \
  --trigger push \
  --sha "$SOURCE_REF" \
  --ref "refs/tags/$TAG"
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
```

Reject the release if any identity, issuer, event, tag/ref, commit, bundle, or
checksum validation differs. `sigstore verify github` uses GitHub's
`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` issuer; a generic Sigstore
verifier must be given that issuer explicitly. The release workflow performs
the same identity and issuer check before publication; its validated
protected-tag context binds the signing run to `source_ref`.

See [Getting started](getting-started.md) for the installer and [Development](development.md)
for the local release gate. The root [README](../README.md) retains a compact
verification command for discoverability, but this page owns the policy.
